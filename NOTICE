   Copyright 2016 The GRIDFIRE Authors

   The initial version of this code was developed by Andrew Luo
   while working within the MIT Boyden Lab as a UROP.

   Image processing algorithms from skimage were used, additionally
   the DBSCAN clustering algorithm by Ester M, Kriegel HP, Sander J,
   and Xu X are used.
